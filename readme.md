## WTF (What This For)
This script can automatically detect human's face in your photo and add a fabulous green hat onto the guy's head.

## How to use
Run greenhat.mï¼š

* To change the face: 

> I = imread('face3.jpg');

 Replace the 'face3.jpg' with your own filename. Do not forget file extension.

 * To change the greenhat:
 > hat = imread('greenhat.png');

 Replace the 'greenhat.png' with your own hat's filename. And again, file extension.
 

 GG!
